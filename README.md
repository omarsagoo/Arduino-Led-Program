# Arduino-Led-Program
Flashes LEDs in a synchronized pattern

This is one of the programs I made years ago in order to learn programming. This is also one of the programs (regardless of how simple it is) that got me the most excited about learning to code. Something as simple as making a few LEDs light up felt so magical!

# Arduino-Led-Program
Flashes LEDs in a synchronized pattern

This is one of the programs I made years ago in order to learn programming. This is also one of the programs (regardless of how simple it is) that got me the most excited about learning to code. 

Something as simple as making a few LEDs light up made me feel like a modern day Sorcerer with programming being the magic coming out of my fingers. I felt as if I could not just create worlds but also create new experiences that we never thought was possible. All of this made me realize that these programming languages that we are creating and using are going to be the way in which we communicate to the world.
